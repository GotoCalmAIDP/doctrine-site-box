# _doctrine — Doctrine Source Materials

**Status:** EMPTY — awaiting approved materials  
**Purpose:** Storage for doctrine core texts and source documents

---

## What This Folder Is For

This folder will contain the **source materials** for doctrine content:

- Core doctrine texts
- Foundational documents
- Approved theoretical frameworks
- Reference materials for doctrine page content

---

## What MUST NOT Be Placed Here Yet

Until explicit authorization:

- ❌ Draft doctrine content
- ❌ Unapproved theoretical claims
- ❌ Speculative frameworks
- ❌ Content from external sources without verification

---

## How This Will Be Extended

### Stage 1: Material Collection
- Approved doctrine source documents will be placed here
- Each document should have clear provenance

### Stage 2: Content Extraction
- Writers will reference these materials when populating `/_content/*/doctrine.md`
- All claims must trace back to documents in this folder

### Stage 3: Version Control
- As doctrine evolves, maintain version history
- Archive superseded versions in a `/archive/` subfolder

---

## File Naming Convention

When adding files:

```
doctrine-core-v1.md
doctrine-scope-definition.md
doctrine-boundaries-v1.md
```

Use lowercase, hyphenated names with version suffixes where applicable.

---

## Integration with Site Content

The `doctrine.md` page in `/_content/en/` and `/_content/ua/` will draw from materials stored here. Maintain clear references between page content and source documents.

---

## Current Status

**EMPTY** — This folder is a placeholder. No materials have been added.
