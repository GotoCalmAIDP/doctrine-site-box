# _cases — Case Study Materials

**Status:** EMPTY — awaiting approved materials  
**Purpose:** Storage for case study source documents and materials

---

## What This Folder Is For

This folder will contain the **source materials** for case studies:

- Individual case documentation
- Supporting evidence and data
- Methodological notes for each case
- Reference materials for case page content

---

## What MUST NOT Be Placed Here Yet

Until explicit authorization:

- ❌ Draft case studies
- ❌ Unverified case materials
- ❌ Speculative analyses
- ❌ Content from external sources without verification

---

## How This Will Be Extended

### Stage 1: Case Collection
- Approved case materials will be placed here
- Each case should have its own subfolder

### Stage 2: Case Documentation
- Writers will reference these materials when populating `/_content/*/cases.md`
- All case claims must trace back to documents in this folder

### Stage 3: Case Index
- As cases are added, update the Case Index in the main cases page
- Maintain consistent naming and numbering

## Folder Structure (Future)

When cases are added:

```
_cases/
├── README.md              ← You are here
├── case-001/
│   ├── summary.md
│   ├── evidence/
│   └── notes.md
├── case-002/
│   └── ...
└── index.md               ← Master case list
```

---

## File Naming Convention

When adding cases:

```
case-001-[short-description]/
case-002-[short-description]/
```

Use sequential numbering with descriptive suffixes.

---

## Integration with Site Content

The `cases.md` page in `/_content/en/` and `/_content/ua/` will draw from materials stored here. Each published case should have:

1. Source materials in this folder
2. Summary in the Case Index
3. Full write-up (if applicable)

---

## Current Status

**EMPTY** — This folder is a placeholder. No cases have been added.
