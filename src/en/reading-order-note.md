# Reading Order Note — How to Read This Doctrine

**Status:** Conceptual note (non-claim)

**Purpose:** This note defines the intended reading order of the site. It exists to prevent misinterpretation that arises when cases or notes are read in isolation or out of sequence.

---

## Start with Conceptual Limits

Readers should begin with the conceptual notes before reading any cases.

These notes establish:

- where explanation applies,
- what counts as evidence,
- and where the doctrine does not operate.

Without these limits, later materials are easily misread as guidance or claims.

---

## Boundary Before Evidence

The Boundary Note should be read first.

It defines where explanation stops.

Evidence has meaning only after this limit is understood.

---

## Evidence Before Scope

The Evidence Note should be read next.

It defines what counts as evidence within the doctrine and what does not.

Scope statements rely on this distinction.

---

## Scope Before Cases

The Scope Note should be read before any case material.

It clarifies where the doctrine applies and where it does not.

Cases assume this scope and do not restate it.

---

## Cases Overview Before Individual Cases

The Cases Overview Note should be read before individual cases.

It provides a structural overview of how cases relate and what boundary each case documents.

Individual cases assume this overview and do not restate it.

---

## Cases Are Illustrative Only

Cases are not conclusions.

They demonstrate how explanation stops without making claims.

Reading cases without the prior notes leads to overinterpretation.

---

## Canonical Status

This Reading Order Note is canonical.

If materials are read or presented out of this order, resulting interpretations are invalid within the doctrine.
