# About the Project

## Purpose

This project exists to provide structured technical documentation in a clear, accessible format. The goal is to create a reference resource that explains specific domains without marketing language or promotional intent.

The site prioritizes precision over persuasion, and explanation over advocacy.

## Why Bilingual

Content is provided in both English and Ukrainian to serve a broader audience and ensure accessibility across language boundaries.
