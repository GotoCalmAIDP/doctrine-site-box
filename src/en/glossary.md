# Glossary v1.0

**Status:** Canonical definitions (non-claim)

**Purpose:** This glossary defines the precise meaning of key terms as used within the doctrine. Terms are defined only to prevent ambiguity. Definitions do not imply causation, obligation, or action.

---

## Applicability

The condition under which an explanatory model can be validly used to describe observed reality without introducing unstated assumptions.

---

## Boundary

The point at which applicability is lost and further explanation under the same assumptions becomes invalid.

---

## Boundary Note

A canonical conceptual note defining the meaning and role of boundaries within the doctrine.

---

## Case

An illustrative, non-claim document that records what can be explained, where explanation ends, and why no further claim is made.

---

## Canonical

Designated as authoritative within the doctrine and not subject to modification, interpretation, or improvement.

---

## Claim

Any assertion of causation, prediction, generalization, optimization, responsibility, or required action.

---

## Compliance Theater

The appearance of assurance created by artifacts or indicators that do not support the claims implied by their presence.

---

## Conceptual Note

A non-claim document defining limits, scope, or interpretation rules without prescribing actions.

---

## Evidence

A recordable and inspectable fact that supports description within defined boundaries, without implying claims.

---

## Evidence Note

A canonical conceptual note defining what counts as evidence and what does not within the doctrine.

---

## Explanation

A description of observed reality that remains valid only while its assumptions hold.

---

## Illustrative

Provided for demonstration only, without claims, conclusions, or recommendations.

---

## Non-Claim

A mode in which no assertions beyond description and boundary recognition are permitted.

---

## Scope

The defined domain within which the doctrine applies, and outside of which it does not operate.

---

## Scope Note

A canonical conceptual note defining where the doctrine applies and where it does not.

---

## Structural Translation

A translation that preserves structure and meaning without interpretation or localization.

---

## Verbatim

Published exactly as written, without alteration.

---

## Canonical Status

This glossary is canonical.

If a term is used with a different meaning, that usage is invalid within the doctrine.
