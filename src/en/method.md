# Method

This page outlines the approach used for documentation on this site.

**Note:** This is documentation of applicability boundaries, not operational recommendations.

---

## 1. Scope & Object

Define what is being documented and what falls outside the scope.

---

## 2. Assumptions (Explicit)

State all assumptions clearly before proceeding with explanation.

---

## 3. Boundaries

Identify where the explanation ends and what it does not cover.

---

## 4. Evidence-First Documentation

Base explanations on observable evidence and documented sources.

---

## 5. Updates Over Time

Revise documentation as new information becomes available.
