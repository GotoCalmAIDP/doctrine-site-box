# Case Template v1.0

**Document Type:** Structural Template  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Canonical

---

## Template Purpose

This document defines the ONLY permitted structure for cases within this documentation system. It is a structural template, not a case. It contains no content, no examples, and no illustrative material.

---

## Mandatory Constraints

All cases created using this template MUST operate in **non-claim mode**:

- No conclusions
- No recommendations
- No causation claims
- No predictions
- No optimization suggestions
- No normative language
- No generalizations beyond observed context

---

## Section 1: Context

### What MAY be written:

- Description of the system or environment under observation
- Observable facts about procedures, artifacts, and configurations
- Temporal markers indicating when observation occurred
- Role limitations of the observer

### What MUST NOT be written:

- Interpretation of why the situation exists
- Evaluation of adequacy or performance
- Attribution of responsibility
- Speculation about future states

---

## Section 2: What Can Be Explained

### What MAY be written:

- Observable patterns in the system
- Structural relationships between components
- Boundary conditions under which the model applies
- Descriptions of what is visible without inference

### What MUST NOT be written:

- Causal claims about why patterns exist
- Predictions about what will happen
- Recommendations for action
- Evaluations of effectiveness

---

## Section 3: Where Explanation Ends

### What MAY be written:

- The specific point at which the model loses applicability
- Conditions under which additional assumptions would be required
- Statement that semantic validity becomes indeterminate
- Acknowledgment of model limits

### What MUST NOT be written:

- Claims about what happens beyond the boundary
- Predictions of failure or success
- Recommendations for extending the model
- Causal explanations for the boundary location

---

## Section 4: Why No Further Claim Is Made

### What MAY be written:

- **Scope limitation:** Statement that the case is bounded by design
- **Evidence constraint:** Statement that available evidence supports description only
- **Authority boundary:** Statement that the observer lacks mandate for normative claims
- **Reversibility principle:** Statement that avoiding claims preserves future reassessment

### What MUST NOT be written:

- Justifications that imply hidden knowledge
- Suggestions that claims could be made with more data
- Recommendations for obtaining additional authority
- Evaluations of the adequacy of current evidence

---

## Section 5: Illustrative Status

### What MAY be written:

- Explicit statement: "This case is illustrative only"
- Statement that the case does not assert failure, inadequacy, or recommendations
- Statement that the case demonstrates structure, not outcomes

### What MUST NOT be written:

- Implications that the case reveals hidden truths
- Suggestions that the illustrative status is temporary
- Claims about what the case "really shows"
- Recommendations derived from the illustration

---

## Section 6: Links to Doctrine Boundaries

### What MAY be written:

- Reference to Scope page
- Reference to Boundaries page
- Reference to Evidence page
- Internal links using relative paths

### What MUST NOT be written:

- Interpretations of what linked pages mean for this case
- Claims that linked pages validate this case
- Recommendations based on linked content
- Summaries of linked page content

---

## Section 7: Case Classification

### What MAY be written:

- **Case Type:** Non-claim, illustrative
- **Boundary Level:** [Specify: Explanatory applicability / Structural / Procedural]
- **Claim Status:** None

### What MUST NOT be written:

- Evaluations of case quality or completeness
- Comparisons with other cases
- Recommendations for classification changes
- Claims about what the classification implies
