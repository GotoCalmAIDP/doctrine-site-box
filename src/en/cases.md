# Case Studies

This page lists illustrative cases that demonstrate how applicability boundaries are documented. Cases are observational and descriptive only — no conclusions, recommendations, or claims are made.

---

## What a Case Is

A case on this site is:

- **Illustrative** — It demonstrates a documentation structure, not a proven method
- **Observational** — It describes what was observed, not what should be done
- **Bounded** — It explicitly states where explanation ends
- **Non-claim** — It does not assert effectiveness, compliance, or certification

Cases are examples of how to document boundaries, not evidence of outcomes.

## Methodological Notes

All cases follow the same structure:

1. **Context** — What situation is being observed
2. **What can be explained** — The scope of description
3. **Where explanation ends** — The explicit boundaries
4. **Why no further claim is made** — The reasoning for limits

This structure ensures that each case remains within the site's [Scope](/en/scope/) and respects the [Boundaries](/en/boundaries/) defined for all content.
