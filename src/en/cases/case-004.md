# Case 004 — Illustrative Non-Claim Case (Update / Change Boundary)

Status: Illustrative only (non-claim)

Purpose:
This case documents a situation in which an explanatory model was initially applicable, but a change in conditions, configuration, or version causes that applicability to no longer hold, without implying error or failure.

---

## Context

The system under observation operates under a defined model that is considered applicable within a known set of conditions.

At the time of initial observation:
- the model explains observed behavior,
- assumptions are explicit and satisfied,
- and no boundary is reached.

Subsequently, a change occurs:
- in system configuration,
- in environment,
- in version, or
- in operating context.

The observer records the change without intervening.

---

## What Can Be Explained

### Before the Change

It can be explained that:
- the model applied under the original conditions,
- observed behavior aligned with its assumptions,
- and explanations were coherent.

### The Change Itself

It can be explained that:
- a change occurred,
- the change is documented as a fact,
- and the system transitioned to a new condition.

No claim is made about the adequacy or intent of the change.

---

## Where Explanation Ends

Explanation ends after the change, when:
- the original assumptions no longer hold,
- the model continues to be used by inertia,
- but its applicability is no longer defensible without modification.

At this boundary:
- continued explanation relies on outdated assumptions,
- correctness before the change does not extend after it,
- and no claim about current behavior is admissible.

This marks a loss of explanatory applicability due to change.

---

## Why No Further Claim Is Made

### Scope Limitation
The case records a boundary caused by change, not the quality of the change.

### Evidence Constraint
Records establish that a change occurred, not that a new model applies.

### Authority Boundary
The observer does not assert responsibility for the change.

### Reversibility
If a new model is later defined, applicability may be restored without contradiction.

---

## Illustrative Status

This case is illustrative only.

It does not:
- assert failure,
- criticize updates,
- or recommend rollback or adjustment.

It demonstrates how applicability can be lost through change alone.
