# Case 002 — Illustrative Non-Claim Case (Trajectory Boundary)

Status: Illustrative only (non-claim)

Purpose:
This case documents a situation in which individual actions and states remain explainable in isolation, while the overall sequence of actions forms a trajectory that can no longer be coherently explained without introducing unstated assumptions.

---

## Context

The system under observation is an operational project environment progressing through a sequence of formally permitted steps. Each step complies with applicable procedures and passes local checks.

At the time of observation:
- No individual action violates defined rules or thresholds.
- Each step is locally justified using available information.
- Oversight and approval mechanisms remain active.
- No incident, fault, or breach is declared.

The observer records the sequence without intervening or influencing decisions.

## What Can Be Explained

### Local Actions

Each individual action can be explained based on:
- the immediately available information,
- the locally applicable procedures,
- and the stated intent at the time.

No single step is inexplicable when considered on its own.

### Step-Level Validity

At each point in the sequence:
- required approvals are present,
- procedural conditions are met,
- and system indicators remain nominal.

Local explanations remain valid.

## Where Explanation Ends

Explanation ends at the level of the trajectory.

While individual steps remain explainable, the sequence as a whole:
- cannot be justified without reconstructing intent after the fact,
- requires assumptions about foresight that were not available at the time,
- and depends on coherence that only appears retrospectively.

The model explains states, but not the path between them.

At this point:
- no causal claim about the outcome is admissible,
- no prediction about continuation is justified,
- and no optimization inference can be made.

This marks a loss of explanatory applicability at the trajectory level.

## Why No Further Claim Is Made

### Scope Limitation
The case documents the boundary of explanation, not the quality of decisions.

### Evidence Constraint
Available records support local description but do not support a coherent end-to-end explanation.

### Authority Boundary
The observer does not assert intent, responsibility, or correctness of actions.

### Reversibility
By avoiding claims, the case remains open to alternative interpretations if new evidence appears.

## Illustrative Status

This case is illustrative only.

It does not:
- assert failure,
- imply error,
- or justify intervention.

It demonstrates how explanation may fail at the level of sequence even when individual steps remain valid.
