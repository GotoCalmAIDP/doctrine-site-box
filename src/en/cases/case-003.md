# Case 003 — Illustrative Non-Claim Case (Authority Boundary)

Status: Illustrative only (non-claim)

Purpose:
This case documents a situation in which formal authority, approval, or human-in-the-loop confirmation is present, while the explanatory basis for that authority is insufficient or no longer applicable.

---

## Context

The system under observation operates under procedures that require human approval or confirmation at defined points.

At the time of observation:
- Required approvals are formally recorded.
- Authorized roles are present and active.
- Oversight mechanisms function as designed.
- No procedural violation or incident is declared.

The observer records the process without attributing intent or responsibility.

---

## What Can Be Explained

### Formal Authority

It can be explained that:
- approvals occurred,
- authorized individuals acted within their defined roles,
- procedural steps were followed.

These facts are supported by records.

### Procedural Validity

From a procedural standpoint:
- required checkpoints were satisfied,
- governance rules were not breached.

Local procedural explanations remain valid.

---

## Where Explanation Ends

Explanation ends at the point where authority is treated as a substitute for explanation.

While approval exists, it cannot be explained:
- what information was epistemically available at the time,
- which assumptions were relied upon,
- or whether the approval meaningfully covered the system state.

Authority confirms that a step was taken.
It does not explain whether the underlying model remained applicable.

At this boundary:
- approval cannot be used as evidence of validity,
- human presence cannot restore applicability,
- and no claim about correctness is admissible.

This marks a loss of explanatory applicability at the authority level.

---

## Why No Further Claim Is Made

### Scope Limitation
The case records the boundary of explanation, not the adequacy of governance.

### Evidence Constraint
Records show that approval occurred, not what was knowable.

### Authority Boundary
The observer does not infer intent, competence, or correctness.

### Reversibility
By avoiding claims, the case remains open to reinterpretation if additional evidence appears.

## Illustrative Status

This case is illustrative only.

It does not:
- assert error,
- challenge authority,
- or recommend changes to governance.

It demonstrates that authority cannot substitute for explanation.
