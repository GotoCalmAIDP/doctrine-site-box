# Scope & Non-Claims

This page defines what this site is, what it is not, and the boundaries of its applicability.

## What This Site Is

- **Certification or accreditation** — No conformity assessment is performed or implied.
- **Legal, financial, or engineering advice** — Content is informational only.
- **Operational instructions** — No implementation guidance or action recommendations.
- **Compliance statements** — Nothing here constitutes regulatory conformity.

## What "Boundaries" Means

The term "boundaries" refers to the explicit limits of what this documentation covers. Where explanation ends, professional judgment begins. This site does not extend into areas requiring licensed expertise or regulatory approval.
