# Cases Overview Note — How the Cases Relate

Status: Conceptual note (non-claim)

Purpose:
This note provides a structural overview of the illustrative cases published within the doctrine. It exists to clarify how cases differ, what type of boundary each case documents, and what remains explainable in each.

---

## Why an Overview Is Necessary

Individual cases are illustrative by design.

Without an overview, cases may appear as isolated examples.
This note prevents that misreading by showing how cases relate structurally.

---

## Case Dimensions Used Here

Cases are distinguished by the level at which explanatory applicability is lost.

This overview uses three dimensions:
- state,
- trajectory,
- authority.

No case is exhaustive.
Each case isolates one boundary.

## Overview Matrix

| Case | Boundary Level | What Remains Explainable | Where Explanation Ends |
|------|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Case 001 | State applicability | Observed system state and structure | Causal interpretation of state |
| Case 002 | Trajectory applicability | Individual steps and local validity | End-to-end sequence coherence |
| Case 003 | Authority applicability | Formal approval and procedure | Epistemic coverage of authority |

## What the Matrix Does Not Do

This matrix does not:
- compare quality,
- rank cases,
- imply progression,
- or suggest mitigation.

It is descriptive only.

---

## Relation to Case Template

All cases conform to Case Template v1.0.

The template enforces:
- non-claim mode,
- explicit boundary recognition,
- reversibility.

This overview does not add to or modify individual cases.

---

## Canonical Status

This Cases Overview Note is canonical.

If it is interpreted as analysis, instruction, or evaluation, that interpretation is invalid.
