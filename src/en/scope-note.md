# Scope Note — Where This Doctrine Applies

**Status:** Conceptual note (non-claim)

**Purpose:** This note defines the scope within which the doctrine is applicable, and the limits beyond which it does not operate. It exists to prevent misapplication, overreach, and false expectations.

---

## What This Doctrine Applies To

This doctrine applies to situations where:

- systems are observed rather than controlled,
- explanations are evaluated rather than optimized,
- boundaries of applicability matter more than outcomes.

It is concerned with:

- descriptive validity,
- limits of explanation,
- and disciplined stopping points.

---

## What This Doctrine Does NOT Apply To

This doctrine does not apply to:

- system design,
- control strategies,
- optimization methods,
- safety assurance,
- compliance certification,
- operational decision-making.

It does not provide:

- actions,
- prescriptions,
- thresholds,
- or guarantees.

---

## Observation, Not Intervention

The doctrine operates in an observational mode.

It documents:

- what can be explained,
- where explanation ends,
- and why no further claim is made.

It does not intervene in systems or processes.

---

## Separation from Governance and Operations

Governance, policy, and operations may use outputs produced under this doctrine.

However, this doctrine does not:

- authorize actions,
- justify decisions,
- or allocate responsibility.

Those functions remain external.

---

## Why Scope Discipline Matters

Without explicit scope limits, descriptive frameworks are often misused as:

- decision tools,
- safety claims,
- or compliance artifacts.

This note exists to prevent that misuse.

---

## Canonical Status

This Scope Note is canonical.

Any interpretation that treats it as instruction, advice, or justification is invalid.
