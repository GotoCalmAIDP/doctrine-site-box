# Evidence Note — What Counts as Evidence Here

**Status:** Conceptual note (non-claim)

**Purpose:** This note defines what counts as acceptable evidence within the doctrine. It does not prescribe operational actions. It exists to prevent "compliance theater" where artifacts exist but do not support the claims implied by their presence.

## Evidence Is a Supportable Fact, Not a Comfort Signal

Evidence is something that can be inspected and verified as a record of what was observed.

Evidence is not:

- confidence,
- reassurance,
- a green dashboard,
- a narrative after the fact.

A system may look healthy while evidence of applicability is missing.

---

## Evidence Types Used in This Doctrine

This doctrine recognizes evidence only in recordable forms.

### Records

A record is a time-bound trace of what occurred:

- inputs and outputs,
- transitions,
- approvals,
- interruptions or stops,
- configuration or model changes.

### Classifications

A classification is an explicit label applied to records using the doctrine's boundaries:

- what remained explainable,
- where explanation ended,
- why no further claim was made.

### Cross-References

A cross-reference links evidence to boundaries and scope:

- which boundary concept applies,
- which scope limit is active,
- which non-claim rule prevents escalation into claims.

---

## What Does NOT Count as Evidence

The following do not count as evidence on their own:

- The existence of a procedure.
- The existence of logs without boundary classification.
- The presence of human approval without a trace of what was visible and knowable.
- "We tested it" without an inspectable record.
- "It complies" without an evidence spine that can be followed.

---

## Evidence Must Not Be Confused with Claims

Evidence supports description.

Evidence does not automatically support:

- causation,
- prediction,
- generalization,
- responsibility assignment.

If a reader can only derive a conclusion by adding unstated assumptions, the doctrine treats that as the point where explanation ends.

---

## Evidence Spine

For any published case or note, evidence must be traceable through:

- scope,
- boundaries,
- and the non-claim rule.

If the spine cannot be followed, the artifact is not evidence-grade within this doctrine.

---

## Canonical Status

This Evidence Note is canonical.

If it is interpreted as advice, instruction, or a warrant for claims, that interpretation is invalid.
