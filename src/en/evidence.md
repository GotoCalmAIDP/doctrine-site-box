# Evidence & Traceability

This page describes what is recorded, what is not claimed, and how changes are tracked.

---

## What We Record

- **Version history** — All changes are tracked in Git with commit hashes.
- **Change log** — Human-readable summary of releases and modifications.
- **Decision artifacts** — Structural decisions are documented in repository files.
- **Timestamps** — Each commit includes date and authorship metadata.

---

## What We Do NOT Claim

- **No guarantee of fitness** — Content is provided "as is" without warranty.
- **No formal conformity statement** — This site does not issue compliance certificates.
- **No third-party validation** — Content has not been audited by external bodies.
- **No operational applicability** — Documentation does not constitute implementation guidance.

---

## How Updates Are Tracked

All changes are managed through Git version control:

- **Commits** — Each change is recorded with a unique identifier.
- **Tags** — Releases may be marked with version tags for reference.
- **Rollback** — Previous versions can be restored from Git history.
- **Public log** — See the [Change Log](/en/change-log/) for a summary.

**Repository:** [github.com/GotoCalmAIDP/doctrine-site-box](https://github.com/GotoCalmAIDP/doctrine-site-box)
