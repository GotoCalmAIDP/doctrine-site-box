# Boundary Note — Applicability and Explanation Limits

**Status:** Conceptual note (non-claim)

**Purpose:** This note defines what is meant by a boundary of applicability within the doctrine. It exists to support interpretation of cases, not to prescribe actions, standards, or decisions.

---

## What a Boundary Is

A boundary marks the point at which an explanatory model can no longer be relied upon to describe reality without introducing unstated assumptions.

A boundary does not imply failure, error, or wrongdoing.

It indicates a limit of explanation, not a breakdown of operation.

A system may remain:

- correct,
- compliant,
- available,
- and procedurally valid,

while no longer being adequately explained by the model used to interpret it.

---

## What a Boundary Is Not

A boundary is not:

- an incident,
- a fault,
- a violation,
- a risk assessment,
- a recommendation to act.

Crossing a boundary does not mandate a response.

It only invalidates further explanation under the same assumptions.

---

## "Everything Is Green" Is Not Evidence

Indicators may remain nominal ("green") even after applicability is lost.

Compliance, availability, and procedural correctness do not guarantee explanatory validity.

Green indicators show that controls are functioning.

They do not show that the model still explains what is happening.

---

## Why No Action Is Prescribed

This doctrine separates explanation from action.

Boundary recognition does not prescribe:

- escalation,
- intervention,
- optimization,
- or correction.

Actions belong to governance, operations, or policy.

This note exists solely to clarify where explanation stops.

---

## Relation to Illustrative Cases

Cases document:

- what can be explained,
- where explanation ends,
- and why no further claim is made.

The Boundary Note provides the conceptual anchor that allows cases to stop without making claims.

Without boundaries, cases drift into interpretation.

With boundaries, cases remain descriptive and reversible.

---

## Non-Claim Integrity

This note makes no assertions about:

- outcomes,
- causation,
- likelihood,
- or correctness of decisions.

It defines a limit of explanation only.

---

## Canonical Status

This Boundary Note is canonical.

If it is interpreted as advice, instruction, or justification, that interpretation is invalid.
